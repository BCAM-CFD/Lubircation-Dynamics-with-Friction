  Code  for  simulating  suspensions  of spherical  particles  in  a
  fluid. The hydrodynamic interactions are modeled using lubrication.
  Variable Stribeck-curve dependent frictional forces are also introduced. Contact friction depend on load, sliding velocity and interstitail liquid viscosity. Particle spins are also considered.
