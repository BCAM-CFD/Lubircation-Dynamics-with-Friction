\section{Introduction}
In  this  paper, the  documentation  for  the  code used  to  simulate
concentrated spherical particles in a fluid, considering lubrication
and friction between particles is
presented. Rotations of the particles are considered.
For further details, the reader may refer to \cite{kumar2021}, for the
description of the dynamics with rotation, and \cite{ruiz2023}, for the
description of the friction model.

\section{The code}
The code is written in Fortran in an Object-Oriented Programming style
(see  \cite{decyk1996}). The  classes  (class*  files) are  programmed
using modules  and type definitions.   Each class has  its subroutines
(inc* files) included in its own files. The main program is written in
main.f90.

To compile  the code,  the gfortran program  must be  installed. Other
fortran compilers  can be used  if the  makefile files are  edited. To
compile the code  type the following in the shell  (within the program
directory):

\begin{verbatim} 
make

make link
\end{verbatim}

To run the program, modify the \emph{input} file and then type:

\begin{verbatim} 
./biviscous_suspension
\end{verbatim}

For a clean recompilation, first type:

\begin{verbatim} 
make clean
\end{verbatim}

The input variables  are read from the \emph{input} file.  In the next
section, the meaning of each variable in the input file is explained.

\subsection{Input Variables}

\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{Nsteps}: Number of steps.

\item \textbf{dt}: Time step.

\item \textbf{explicit}: \texttt{.TRUE.} if the explicit scheme is used; \texttt{.FALSE.} if the semi-implicit scheme \cite{bian2014,vazquez2016a,vazquez2016b} is used.

\item \textbf{sweep\_tol}: Tolerance for the semi-implicit scheme \cite{bian2014,vazquez2016a,vazquez2016b}. Used only if \textbf{explicit} = \texttt{.FALSE.}.

\item \textbf{eta1}: When the biviscous model is considered \cite{vazquez2016c}, \textbf{eta1} is the shear viscosity $\eta_1$ at high shear rates. Used only if \textbf{biviscous} = \texttt{.TRUE.}.

\item \textbf{gamma\_dot}: The imposed shear rate $\dot{\gamma}$.

\item \textbf{gamma\_dot\_critical}: In the case of a bi-viscous fluid, the critical shear rate.

\item \textbf{biviscous}: \texttt{.FALSE.} if the solvent is Newtonian; \texttt{.TRUE.} if it is biviscous.

\item \textbf{N}: Number of particles. Used only if \textbf{read\_pos} = \texttt{.FALSE.}.

\item \textbf{R}: Radius of particles.

\item \textbf{mass}: Mass of particles.

\subsection{Before Simulating}
To create the initial configuration of particles, the algorithm of the
code randomly fills the space with non-overlapping particles at random
positions. This  approach works well  for low concentrations,  but for
concentrated cases, it may not  achieve a valid configuration. In such
cases, the initial configuration should be provided by the user to the
program  as   input  so  that   the  program  can  read   the  initial
configuration.

The  tools to  build  the  initial configuration  are  located in  the
directory  \emph{to\_prepare\_initial\_configuration}.  A Monte  Carlo
simulation is used  for this task. For more  information, please refer
to the \emph{readme} file in that directory.

\section{The model}
This section discusses the non-functionalized model  described in \cite{kumar2020}.
Given its similarity to the functionalized model, it could be
useful to the reader.

\subsection{Some Calculations}

\subsubsection{Viscosity from the Wall}

Given that the walls are oriented in the $z$ direction, only the components $\sigma_{zx}$, $\sigma_{zy}$, and $\sigma_{zz}$ of the stress can be calculated:
\begin{eqnarray}
  \sigma_{zx} &=& \frac{F_{\text{wall}}^x}{L_xL_y} \nonumber \\
  \sigma_{zy} &=& \frac{F_{\text{wall}}^y}{L_xL_y} \nonumber \\
  \sigma_{zz} &=& \frac{F_{\text{wall}}^z}{L_xL_y}
\end{eqnarray}

The viscosity of the suspension is calculated as
\begin{eqnarray}
  \eta &=& \frac{\sigma_{zx}}{\dot{\gamma}} \label{eta_from_stress}
\end{eqnarray}
Note that, in general, the shear rate generated by the wall is not exactly the input shear rate, due to some slip with the walls (see Fig. \ref{slip_fig}).

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{figs/slip}
\caption{Slip in the simulations for a suspension with concentration $\phi = 0.4$.}
\label{slip_fig}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Viscosity from the Irving-Kirkwood Method}

The stress tensor can also be calculated via the Irving-Kirkwood method \cite{irving1950}. Following this method, the stress tensor is calculated from the positions and forces between particles as \cite{bertevas2010,phan2014}:
\begin{eqnarray}
  \boldsymbol{\sigma} &=& \frac{1}{V}\left[\sum_i\boldsymbol{v}_i\boldsymbol{v}_i +
    \frac{1}{2}\sum_i\sum_{j\ne i}\boldsymbol{r}_{ij}\boldsymbol{F}_{ij}\right]
\end{eqnarray}
From the stress tensor, the viscosity can be calculated using Eq. (\ref{eta_from_stress}).

\subsubsection{Comparison of Both Methods}

Results obtained with both methods are compared in this section. The system consists of a suspension with concentration $\phi = 0.4$ in a shear flow between planar walls. Figure \ref{IK_wall_comp} shows the evolution of the ratio $S_{zx}^{\text{wall}} / S_{zx}^{\text{IK}}$ for three different time steps. Although convergence is achieved for $dt = 10^{-4}$ when the stress is calculated from the wall (result not shown here), convergence with the Irving-Kirkwood method requires a time step that is ten times smaller ($dt = 10^{-5}$).

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{figs/IK_wall_comp}
\caption{Comparison of the ratio of the component $S_{zx}$ calculated with the wall and the component $S_{zx}$ calculated via the Irving-Kirkwood method.}
\label{IK_wall_comp}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Faster Way to Obtain Irving-Kirkwood Results}

It has been observed that the Irving-Kirkwood results for the stress tensor are accurate only for very small time steps. To obtain results more quickly using the Irving-Kirkwood approach, one can run a simulation with a relatively large time step $dt$. Afterwards, in post-processing, the simulation can be continued for a few steps starting from the collected data until the Irving-Kirkwood result reaches a quasi-steady state. Results from such a post-processing calculation have been compared with those from simulations with smaller time steps, showing almost identical results, as depicted in Figure \ref{post_processing_fig}.

To perform the post-processing calculation of the stress tensor, use the script \emph{script\_stress.sh} in the scripts directory.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{figs/stress_post_processing}
\caption{Comparison of the temporal evolution of the $S_{zx}$ component of the stress calculated with the proposed post-processing method and another simulation with a smaller time step.}
\label{post_processing_fig}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Calculation of the Normal Stress Differences}

The normal stress differences are calculated from the stress tensor as
\begin{eqnarray}
  N_1 &=& \frac{\sigma_{xx} - \sigma_{zz}}{\eta_0 \dot{\gamma}} \nonumber \\
  N_2 &=& \frac{\sigma_{zz} - \sigma_{yy}}{\eta_0 \dot{\gamma}}
\end{eqnarray}

\subsubsection{Viscosity and Normal Stress Differences Versus Concentration}

The dependency of viscosity and normal stress differences on the concentration $\phi$ is shown in Figure \ref{eta_N1_N2}. The normal stress differences are defined as
\begin{eqnarray}
  N_1 &=& \frac{S_{xx} - S_{zz}}{\eta_0 \dot{\gamma}} \nonumber \\
  N_2 &=& \frac{S_{zz} - S_{yy}}{\eta_0 \dot{\gamma}}
\end{eqnarray}
Although the agreement is good for the viscosity of the suspension and for $N_2$, the magnitude of $N_1$ is significantly larger than that obtained by Bertevas et al. It has been verified that the results for $N_1$ and $N_2$ are not sensitive to changes in the cutoff radius and the size of the simulation box (results for $N_1$ and $N_2$ shown in the figures are from a simulation box of size $L = 32 \times 32 \times 32$).
